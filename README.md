Update of spijkermennos mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2904885736

### Changes



-  Changed to a recursive calculation instead of set values
-  Added mod-option for setting the chance of multiple births
-  Added a gene that increases the chance of multiple births
-  The mod will no longer override the birth code, it will just call it again when birthing multiple children
-  Added translation strings

A Rimworld mod that allows your pawns to give birth to twins, triplets or quadruplet.

Current chances of giving birth to multiple babies are:
		
Twins: 5% 
Triplets: 1%
Quadruplets: 0.5%
		
Anyone here got some experience in modding the new genes? Would love to team up to make this a gene.

Contact me via DM please.
		
V0.16a
